# Jeffbrain 2
## Program C
Jeffbrain 2 is the software for our VEX V5 robot, which we've named Jeff 2.

This is Jeffbrain 2 (Program C), which is written in C++. There are two other versions of the program.

See jeffbrain2-a and jeffbrain2-b for more information.

Jeffbrain 2 (Program C) is our most advanced version of Jeffbrain 2.

It features temperature monitors for the four motors on Jeff 2, an autonomous routine selector with 6 routines, an image selector (which currently only has one image), a settings menu (which currently only has one setting, a Control Mode setting), and a Material Design 3 (Material You) style.
